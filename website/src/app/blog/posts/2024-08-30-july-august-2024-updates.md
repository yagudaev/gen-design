I know it's been a while; the summer has been busy with healthy activities and friends ☀️.

It's time to get back in the groove and crush Q3 together. 🎯

## Updates

### 1. Play audio from your Podcast Player 🔗

If you love podcast like me, you would surely have lots of great pods. Why not add all the articles you "should read" or books to your podcast player?

Well, we added a new feature so you can do just that. Now, you can get a URL to an RSS feed and add it to your podcast player. Take a look at the video below 👇

[![AudiowaveAI Podcast Player Demo](https://gallery.eocampaign1.com/79a3f9e0-e3c5-11ee-bd4c-6173a3977da7%2Fvideo-thumbnail%2F2c95bfa1e27dee6ac1c7f6bb037f3410_0.png)](https://youtu.be/ag2WslQwNJQ)

Reasons why you might want to do that:

- 🌐❌ Offline Listening
- 🧩🔊 Integration to smart speakers - e.g. new cars can play podcasts
- ✅🎧 Keep track of all content you listen to in one place

Give it a try and let us know what you think 💭

### 2. Process multiple chapters from the Project page ⚙️

There is no need to go into each chapter; you can convert all chapters into audio by clicking the process button on the Project page.

### 3. Basic Search 🔍

We added a basic keyword search to help you find a specific project.

### 4. Split long chapters to ~1hour parts 🐞

We had an issue handling long chapters or texts that span many hours. To fix it we simply split the text into multiple parts.

This also helps you keep better track of where you are when listening to the output.

Thanks for reporting this issue, Josh and James and a few others 😊

## What's next?

**We are planning for version 2.0!**

Our designer friends at [IterateUX](https://www.iterateux.com/) are going to help me talk to all of you and come up with the game plan for V2.

We have a lot of ideas! 💡 Stay tuned for more on that.

Feel free to reply with your thoughts; I always get back to each email.

## Spreading the Word + Bug Reports - Thank you! 🙏

You've been an incredible inspiration for sharing it with friends on social media, writing a bug report or suggesting a new feature.

Thank you! This makes it all worthwhile and helps me focus more on improving the product, which is by far my favourite thing to do.

Thank you, Roberto, Mattia and Jesse, for sharing on social media.

Thank you to Peter, James, Josh and countless others for reporting problems and making incredible product suggestions.

Cheers 🍻,

Your friendly neighbourhood developer
