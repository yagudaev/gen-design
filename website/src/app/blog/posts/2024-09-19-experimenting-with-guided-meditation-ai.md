One of the things I always wanted AudiowaveAI to help me with was meditation. As I implemented the new multiple voices feature, I tried finding a voice that would be a good fit for a guided meditation audio. However, I wasn't quite getting the results I wanted.

It wasn't enough to just have a generic female voice, the pauses needed to be longer and the AI needed a bit more context on how to read the script.

So I decided to try combining a few AI tools together and see what I can come up with.

## Tools

- Script: ChatGPT
- Speech Audio: Microsoft Neural AI
- Background Music: Stability Audio 1.0
- Video: Stock Footage from Veed

## Conclusion

I'm pretty happy with the results, and I'm looking forward to experimenting with this more. I'll be adding some full length guided meditation to AudiowaveAI soon.

What do you think? Would you like to see more guided meditations in AudiowaveAI?
