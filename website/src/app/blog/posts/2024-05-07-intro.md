Hi Friends 👋,

Hope you are enjoying the start of the spring ☀️.

This is the season to go outside and enjoy the outdoors. Which means learning while you are on a walk, run, bike ride or that long road trip you've been planning.

To help, I wanted to introduce a new product: AudioWaveAI.com which I built to help me convert a book not available as an audiobook to audio.

Only 3% of books are available as audio and maybe 1% of online content. If you are like me and the last thing you want to do is spend more time indoors sitting staring at text, then you'll love this.

Why a new product and not just a feature of QuickReadAI? Well, QR is really good helping you find the answers you need in text, cutting through the noise. But if you are still exploring and don't quite know what you are looking for, listening to new ideas passively is a great way to get inspired.

This is still an early release, so I would love your feedback 💌🙏. Just reply with your thoughts below or any questions.

P.S.

Below are a couple of great samples of audio produced with AudioWaveAI so far:

1. 9 Products Perfect for Developers to Make
2. Why you shouldn't apply to YC
3. ROI on Design
4. Paul Graham - Default Alive or Default Dead

P.S. 2.

Next time expect a few updates to QuickRead inspired by AudioWaveAI -- love all your feedback so far. Coming soon...

Cheers 🍻,

Your friendly neighbourhood developer

Michael Yagudaev
