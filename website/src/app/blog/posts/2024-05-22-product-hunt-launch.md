Hi Friends üëã,

Hope you are having a great week ‚òÄÔ∏è (half way to weekend!)

Tonight (12:01am PST), I'm finally launching AudiowaveAI on Product Hunt üöÄ.

I've been using it daily for a few weeks now and it's been a blast going through high quality content I just never had time to read.

I need your help üôè, feedback like this is gold üëá

> "When I edit the text. And use enter , the edit box closes. So I need to click edit again, find the text, update... many times" -- Frederik

While it seems simple, it helps quickly improve the product (and yes, unlike a mega corp, I can implement the feedback within minutes).

## I would love your feedback on:

1. Landing Page (i.e. website)
2. Onboarding (when you first join, is anything confusing? Anything you are not sure about?)
3. Any unexpected things you encounter in the UI

This is still an early release, so I would love your feedback üíåüôè. Just reply with your thoughts below or any questions.

3. [Stop Asking Questions by Andrew Warner](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Asking-Questions-High-Impact-Interviews/dp/1737676516)

And yep all of those are available as audiobooks I converted, just ping me with a receipt and I'll share the audio files with you üòä.
